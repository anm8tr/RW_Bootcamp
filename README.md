* Programming Experience: Started in Swift 3.1 originally several years ago, now working with Swift 5.0 and still learning as much as possible. I started with UIKit in 2017 originally but did not start studying part time until the summer of 2018. I started studying SwiftUI in October of 2019 through May 2020. 

* Programming Goals: To master UIKit as thorough as possible, learn more SwiftUI and then start on several personal projects which I plan to release to the App Store. I want to start a freelancing business eventually.  

* Hobbies & Interests: I'm a licensed pilot, certified diver, I like skiing and snowboarding, biking and woodworking.
